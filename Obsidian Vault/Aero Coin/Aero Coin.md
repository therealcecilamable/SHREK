#### Goal
- A telegram airdrop to get money without any investment
- Just another one of the telegram airdrops but people have to deposit their $TON, basicly make a transaction to enter
- With some kind of reward system to reward players but there will not be actually any token to give but just numbers
- get twitter (X) blue verified to make it legit
- have a website, a one page website, will work on it later
	- or three page or something,
	- home, blog, read blog
- make it like blum coin, with just mining
	- make a tier system so only player who make it to a certain tier get to qualify for the airdrop
	- must have referral to qualify
	- must make a ton transaction to qualify
	- must follow channel
	- must follow X
	- must get to a specific tier min
- giveaways will be claimed in tokens in the airdrop which are fake
- a leaderboard system to add competion for players to refer more and make bigger transactions
	- basically like a POS system for people with the heighest ton stake get a higher drop
	- Fake promise, all the ton will be added to your wallet at the end of the drop, it's just to verify or something like that [rip out a page from bitwin's book]
