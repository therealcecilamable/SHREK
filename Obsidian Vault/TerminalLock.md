>> **A secure and private way to communicate in the terminal**

### Encryption method
**Asymetric encryption [i think so]**
	- both public and private keys will be generated
	- the creator of the chat will use both public keys to create the room
	- the private key will be use to get acces to the chat
	- for easier access, there'll be a way to set a 6 digit pin to get access
	- the creator of the chat will be the server 
	- all chats and resources will be lost after killing the chat 
	- lost internet connection will not close the chat, it'll keep searching for the lost connection
	- all these will be happening in the background, other things will be printed, but you can still open a new window to view the verbous output + log of what's actually going on
