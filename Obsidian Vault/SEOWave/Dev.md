Great! Let's begin.

### **Step 1: Core Features Implementation**

We'll start by breaking down the core features:

1. **Keyword Research**
   - Scrape keyword data from search engines or use available APIs.
   - Store and categorize keywords by volume, competition, and trends.

2. **Competitor Analysis**
   - Gather data on competitors' keywords, backlinks, and ranking positions.
   - Implement tools to compare this data with the user's own SEO metrics.

3. **Rank Tracking**
   - Develop a system to monitor keyword rankings over time.
   - Visualize rank changes using graphs or charts.

4. **Backlink Analysis**
   - Collect and analyze backlinks to determine their quality and impact.
   - Provide suggestions for building or disavowing backlinks.

5. **On-page SEO Audit**
   - Scan web pages for SEO issues like broken links, missing tags, and content optimization.
   - Generate reports with actionable insights.

6. **Content Suggestions**
   - Analyze current content and suggest improvements based on keyword usage, readability, and relevance.
   - Offer new content ideas based on keyword gaps.

### **Step 2: Technology Stack Setup**

#### **Backend Setup**
- **Python**: We'll go with Django for a robust framework.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is a strong choice for handling complex queries.

#### **Frontend Setup**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies.
- **React.js**: For a dynamic and responsive front-end experience.

#### **APIs and Data Sources**
- **Google Search Console API**: For rank tracking and keyword data.
- **Other SEO APIs**: We can explore additional APIs for data enrichment.

### **Step 3: Development Environment**

Let's get the environment set up:

1. **Install Tools**
   - Install Python.
   - Install VSCode.
   - Set up Git and connect to a repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Set up a virtual environment in Python.
   - Install Django and necessary dependencies using `pip`.

Do you have everything set up, or would you like guidance on any of these steps?
